<h2>Installation</h2>
Just put CoalDiamonds.jar in plugins folder. Config.yml will be created automatically. You can edit everything in your config by commands.
<h2>Chance System</h2>
If you have percentage on default value (100) and for example diamond pickaxe chance on 3, you will have 3% chance to drop diamond from coal ore. If you have percentage value on 200 and diamond pickaxe chance on 3, you will have 1,5% chance. If you have percentage on default value (100) and diamond pickaxe 50, you will have 50% chance to drop. But if you have percentage on 200 and diamond pickaxe on 50, you will have only 25% chance.
